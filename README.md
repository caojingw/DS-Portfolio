- predicted Amazon textual review helpfulness using Azure Databricks, achieving second place among 12 teams.
- I used Spark/Databricks to work with Big Data to build ML models using textual features and estimated the costs of Big Data projects in the cloud.

- The objective of this project is to predict if water pump are functional.
- We scored in the top 1% out of 3000+ teams in predicting pump functionality, utilizing a voting ensemble method of LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest.                                                                          


<img align="left" width="180" height="100" src="Images\houseprice.jpeg"> **[House Price Prediction](https://github.com/caojingw/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques)**
 
- Used Lasso and Ridge regressions to predict the house price to get the top 20% on the leaderboard.
- Dealt with missing instances, feature engineering and normalization to minimize the RSME by 10%

<img align="left" width="180" height="150" src="Images\flask.png"> **[Students Performance with Flask & GCP](https://github.com/caojingw/student_performance_prediction.git)**
 
- Build a Web App with Flask
- Modular coding instead of writing "Spaghetti" code
- Deploy and host on Google Cloud Platform App Engine
- Alternatively, containerize with Docker and Deploy on GCP
