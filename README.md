In this project, I was given Amazon review text data to analyze and predict the reviews' usefulness.Teams will use Azure Databricks (which is based on Apache Spark) to analyze and model a large, textual dataset. The goals of this project are threefold:
1. Learn how to use Spark/Databricks to work with Big Data from the real world.
2. Further your knowledge and experience of building ML models using textual features
3. Estimate the costs of Big Data projects in the cloud.

The objective of this project is to use data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all?
