The objective of this project is to use data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? We Scored in the top 1% out of 3000+ teams in predicting pump functionality, utilizing a voting ensemble method of LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest.

- Dealt with missing instances, feature engineering and normalization to minimize the RSME by 10%
